# Architecture

## Technology target

- Godot 4.x stable.
- GDScript.
- Web export using the compatibility renderer.
- Firefox desktop is the primary browser target.
- No native-only plugin may be required for Chapter One.
- No external backend is required to play.
- Save data uses Godot user storage/local browser persistence.

## Authoring model

Content is data-driven, but only where that lowers chapter-authoring cost.

Use Godot Resources or JSON-like dictionaries for:
- clue definitions;
- deduction definitions;
- dialogue nodes;
- hotspot metadata;
- room transitions.

Do **not** build a general-purpose visual scripting language.

## Core runtime services

### GameState

Owns the canonical serializable state:
- current room;
- clues;
- deductions;
- hypotheses;
- witness trust;
- chapter flags;
- skill values;
- inventory;
- playtime.

No room scene is allowed to be the sole owner of critical story state.

### SceneRouter

Handles:
- room changes;
- transition locks;
- spawn markers;
- auto-save hooks.

### InteractionController

Normalizes mouse input into:
- walk;
- inspect;
- interact;
- talk;
- present evidence;
- transition.

Hotspots declare allowed contextual actions.

### EvidenceService

Responsibilities:
- register clue acquisition;
- merge upgraded clue detail;
- surface relevant evidence for current context;
- publish evidence-added events.

### DeductionService

Evaluates authored deduction rules against canonical state.

Rules are declarative:
- required clue IDs;
- minimum support count;
- exclusion/contradiction conditions;
- prerequisite deductions;
- optional skill insight.

The service never guesses deductions from free text.

### DialogueService

Runs graph-based authored conversations.

Node conditions can inspect:
- clue/deduction state;
- trust;
- skills;
- chapter flags.

Node effects can:
- add clue;
- change trust;
- set flag;
- open topic;
- transition conversation.

### SaveService

Versioned save schema.

Must support:
- manual save slots;
- quick auto-save;
- schema version;
- content version;
- migration hook.

Web persistence must be exercised in Firefox before Chapter One is called done.

## Room contract

Every room is a Godot scene implementing a small common interface.

Required child concepts:
- visual background;
- simple authored walk bounds;
- `PlayerActor`;
- `Hotspots` container;
- optional NPC actors;
- named spawn markers for transitions.

The reusable Slice 3 room controller owns:
- click-to-walk dispatch;
- movement clamping to walk bounds;
- hotspot registration;
- approach-before-primary-action behavior;
- inspect dispatch;
- held hotspot reveal;
- transition requests through `SceneRouter`;
- status/hover signals to the shell HUD.

Rooms do not hardcode cross-chapter systems.

### Hotspot contract

A hotspot declares:
- stable `hotspot_id`;
- player-facing label;
- inspect text;
- primary-action feedback;
- optional approach point;
- optional destination room + destination spawn;
- enabled/disabled state.

Hotspots emit primary/inspect actions and hover changes. They do not own case-state logic.

## Movement

Point-and-click destination movement uses a lightweight visual actor. Destinations are clamped to an authored per-room `Rect2` walk region.

This is intentionally simpler than general pathfinding for the current room layouts. NavigationRegion2D remains available if a later authored room genuinely needs obstacle routing; it is not required by default.

## Testing strategy

### Fast script tests

Headless tests cover:
- clue acquisition idempotence;
- deduction rules;
- dialogue conditions/effects;
- save serialize/deserialize;
- migration behavior.

### Protected progression tests

A scripted Chapter One golden path validates:
- every required deduction can be reached;
- all scene transitions resolve;
- the chapter ending is reachable from a fresh save.

A second route intentionally misses optional clues and uses alternate critical-clue paths.

### Web smoke

For release slices:
- export web build;
- serve locally or via Pages;
- load in Firefox;
- new game;
- one room transition;
- notebook open/close;
- save/load;
- audio unlock after user gesture;
- chapter completion path on final release.

## Performance budget

The project should remain modest enough for ordinary desktop Firefox:
- static 2D backgrounds;
- small sprite animation sets;
- no dynamic 3D;
- no compute shaders;
- no large runtime-generated textures;
- no continuous simulation outside the active room.

## Git discipline

- Main remains playable after implementation slices once the first playable scaffold exists.
- Every slice updates `CURRENT.md`.
- Do not expand scope during implementation unless a concrete blocker demands it.
